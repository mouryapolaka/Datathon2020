Upskill is an application that enables job seekers to better understand what skills employers are looking for in their associated industry using historical and real-time data on job postings. Our tool utilises a recommendation system to suggest skills for users who are interested in expanding their current skillset and potentially pick up complementing skills that are sought out by employers.
